About me
======
I am a PhD student in mathematics at the [Mathematical Institute](https://www.uni-muenster.de/MathematischesInstitut/en/index.shtml) of the [University of Münster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/en/). I am a member of the Cluster of Excellence "Mathematics Münster: Dynamics – Geometry – Structure" and the CRC 1442 "Geometry: Deformations and Rigidity". My supervisor is Anna Siffert.

Research interests
======
My research interests lie in the field of geometric analysis and submanifold theory. Currently, I am working with geometric objects arising from variational problems such as Hamonic Maps or Polyharmonic Submanifolds.
